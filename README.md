# Soccer-Player-Detector
Soccer player detector uses an artificial CNN to identify and categorize players on the pitch according to their matching teams using a soccer video as its input. Following categorization, each participant will be assigned to a manually drawn map of the playing area. This project is our final project at KNTU vision course spring 2021.
